# 2nd Belgian SDR Meetup on Friday 4/9/2020

As announced, the next Belgian UBA SDR Meetup will be held on 4/9/2020.
(see information at the bottom of this message)
  
## GNU Radio  
The meeting will include a small presentation and demonstration of GNU Radio, in fact, a complete walk-through of an GNU Radio flowgraph + some python-code.
For that reason, having some background on GNU Radio, GRC (GNU Radio Companion) and some of the underlying principles of signals will surely help
understand the presentation.  
  
For that, especially people who are new to GNU Radio- to already take the time to watch some video's on this topic:
the excellent "Software Defined Radio with HackRF" video-course by Michael Ossmann.  
  
The videos can be found here:  
[sdr with the hackRF] (https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/)  
  
The complete videocourse is 11 video's in total, totalling in about 2 hours of viewing-time. If you do not have time to watch them all, The following ones are
the most interesting to give a good first impression of some of the topics that will be discussed during the meetup:  
  
* [1 Welcome](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/1/)  
* [2 DSP](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/2/)  
* [4 Mysteries](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/4/)  
* [6 Complex Numbers](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/6/)  
* [7 Complex Numbers in DSP](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/7/)  
  

## Understanding signals:  
SDR is based on signal-processing. These two videos provide some background on two aspects of SDR that do not exist in analog electronics:
IQ signals and negative Frequencies:  
  
* Basics of IQ Signals and IQ modulation & demodulation - A tutorial  
[video](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic/ee-ac-analysis/v/ee-negative-frequency)  
  
* Negative Frequencies

See you at the Meetup!
