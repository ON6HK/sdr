# UBA Belgian SDR Meetup 30.10.2020

Please note that this Friday, 30 October, the 3th UBA Belgian (online) SDR Meetup will be organised.

As the previous meetup's, the event will be held online (jitsi link, see below), starting at 20h00.

The agenda is as follows:
- Question & Answer round:
This allows everybody to ask questions on SDR, show of any SDR related projects you are working on, or just introduce yourself.

- The solution of the two CTF challenges.

CTF1:

 Question: "what time (date/hour) was this recording made?"

 Hint: "the question is also a hint"


- A small presentation of the 'Elektor SDR shield' project.
What have we learned sofar? How well does it work?
How does SDR receiver hardware actually work and what are the pitfalls?

- Time permitting, we can have a free discussion afterwards on any SDR related topic.

Like last time, the Meetup starts at 20:00. The presentations start around 20:30 and should be finished between 21:30-22:00
